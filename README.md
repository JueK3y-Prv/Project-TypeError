# Project LVM | A website for the sale of shoes (online store)

###### _This is a closed project, which is created by the order of a client. The German copyright regulations apply._

## What is the LVM website?
The website offers clothing products (shoes) for resale. In this project, for this reason,
<br>a visually striking website should be created, which should be fully functional and contain (at least) the following features:
- Landing Page (Index)
- Web store
- About TypeError - page
- Contact (per Email)
- Legal (AGB / Terms)
- It also includes:
  - Automatic detection for Light / Dark mode
  - Switch between those two modes
  - Automatic detection of EN or DE language
  - Change between EN and DE
<br>

## When will the website be published?
The process of the site is divided into 4 points.
- Planning
- Design phase
- Creation of the website (frontend)
- Linking the site with backend

The project is currently in the early phase of "Creation of the website".
<br>At the moment there are 4 web pages. These are Index and 404 for both languages
<br>If there is an exact date, this paragraph will be updated _(*)_. 
###### _(*) Paragraph updated on 01. March 2021_
<br>

## What is the URL of the website?
The only working domain is [this one](https://type-error.netlify.app).
<br>Work is underway to forward an automatic redirect from the GitHub page to this address.
<br>A domain without a Netlify subdomain does not exist at this time.

<br>

## The website only works incorrectly for me / I have found errors
This may well occur in an unfinished website.
<br>I would appreciate it if you would then open a [new issue](https://github.com/JueK3y/project-lvm/issues) so I can take care of the bug.
<br>Thanks for your help!

# Project LVM | A website for the sale of shoes (online store)

###### _This is a closed project, which is created by the order of a client. The German copyright regulations apply._

## What is the LVM website?
The website offers clothing products (shoes) for resale. In this project, for this reason,
<br>a visually striking website should be created, which should be fully functional and contain (at least) the following features:
- Landing Page
- Web store
- Contact us
- Legal
<br>

## When will the website be published?
Since the project has only just started, it may be some time before a schedule can even emerge. Since I (JueK3y) also have 2 other projects ([IAC](https://github.com/JueK3y/Instagram-automated-commenting) & [juek3y.com](https://github.com/JueK3y/juek3y.com)) going on the side, a short term completion (for example in 2 weeks) will not be foreseeable.
<br>If there is an exact date, this paragraph will be updated _(*)_.

## What is the URL of the website?
This question has 3 answers. Currently you can access the site via the [GitHub Pages](https://juek3y.github.io/project-lvm/) or the [Netlify link](https://lvm.netlify.app/). However, I want to create a subdomain for juek3y.com so that the site is easier to reach and still includes all the features.
<br>As above, I will update this article as soon as there is a new link.
<br>Please note that the website is still a work in progress. Legal information will therefore be filled in with placeholders for now. You may also not get a hint for cookies, although some may already be in use. So assume that the website uses cookies.

<br>

## The website only works incorrectly for me / I have found errors
This may well occur in an unfinished website.
<br>I would appreciate it if you would then open a [new issue](https://github.com/JueK3y/project-lvm/issues) so I can take care of the bug.
<br>Thanks for your help!
